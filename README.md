# Algorithmic Trading - Optional

Now, it's time to take what you've learned about Deep Learning and apply it to new situations. For this optional assignment, you'll may pick from two Algorithmic Trading Challenges. Which challenge you take on is your choice. Just be sure to give it your all -- as the skills you hone will become powerful tools in your FinTech tool belt.

## Option 1 - High Frequency Trading Algorithm

### Background

Due to the volatility in investment performance of human portfolio managers, many investment firms rely on trading algorithms to produce consistent investment performance capable of outperforming the markets. One such investing strategy is the combination of Machine Learning Algortihms and High Frequency Algorithms. This strategy has become very popular and requires skills from multiple of the previous units, such as automatically retrieving data used to make investment decisions, training a model, and building an algorithm to execute the trading.

You have been tasked by the investment firm Renaissance High Frequency Trading (RHFT) to develop such an algorithm. RHFT wants the algorithm to be based on stock market data for `FB`, `AMZN`, `AAPL`, `NFLX`, `GOOGL`, `MSFT`, and `TSLA` at the minute level. It should conduct buys and sells every minute based on 1 min, 5 min, and 10 min Momentum. The CIO asked you to choose the Machine Learning Algorithm best suited for this task and wants you to execute the trades via Alpaca's API.

## Option 2 - Machine Learning Trading Bot

### Background

In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.
